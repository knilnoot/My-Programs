Welcome to the code of super smash bros. java!
This file gives a general idea of how the whole code (as of 2/5/2020) works

The program starts on the MakeJFrame class, which pretty much just makes the window and starts the SuperSmashBrosJavaMelee class.

The SSBJM class does several things:
    1.It paints everything to the screen and calculates everything important for that.
    2.It handles collisions between objects (players, levelBlocks, attacks).
    3.It takes keyboard and mouse inputs.
    4.It takes care of level creation

The SSBJM class keeps track of several LevelBlock objects.
LevelBlock Objects are pretty much just rectangles that players and attacks can collide with.

a few classes hold Sprite objects
Sprite objects hold a bufferedImage that becomes another image through the update function.

The SSBJM class holds a list of player objects
I'm bored, so I'll stop here.
